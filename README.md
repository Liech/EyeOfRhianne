# Build and Run

 * You need git, cmake and Visual Studio (Any other IDE is fine, but may require other steps)
 * After checking out this project make sure all submodules are up to date.
 * Then execute the 0,1 and 2 .bat files in the Yathsou submodule to set up vcpkg.
 * If you are using Linux: Good Luck, it could work but is not tested.
 * If you are used to cmake: Make sure to set the vcpkg toolchain file.
 * If not read the 3 file or ask me personally
